        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Brian, a current 3rd year computer science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I'm a person
            who loves to stay active, be outside, and hangout with friends. I am very passionate about all aspects of my health and strive to be the best
            version of myself at all times. A future goal of mine would be to travel the world to see all that it has to offer. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When it comes to school, I have always been interested in STEM and I settled on computer science because of the problem solving and creativity
            that it involves. I aspire to be a software engineer at a company that inspires change and has a positive impact on the world. I am a dedicated 
            worker and I belive that my greatest strength would be my communication skills and my ability to work with others on projects.
